Certainly! Here's where you can acquire the datasets for each of the projects I mentioned:

1. **MNIST Digit Recognition:**
   - **Dataset:** The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
   - **Source:** You can load it directly via TensorFlow or PyTorch. For example, in TensorFlow:
     ```python
     from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
     (train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
     ```

2. **Iris Species Classification:**
   - **Dataset:** The Iris dataset.
   - **Source:** Available in the `scikit-learn` library or from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. With `scikit-learn`:
     ```python
     from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
     iris = load_iris()
     ```

3. **Titanic Survival Prediction:**
   - **Dataset:** Titanic dataset.
   - **Source:** Available on Kaggle, which provides a comprehensive dataset for this problem.
     - [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)

4. **Stock Prices Prediction:**
   - **Dataset:** Historical stock prices.
   - **Source:** You can use APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl to fetch historical stock data. For example, using `yfinance` to download stock data:
     ```python
     import yfinance as yf
     data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2010-01-01", end="2021-01-01")
     ```

5. **Sentiment Analysis of Tweets:**
   - **Dataset:** Tweets.
   - **Source:** You might need to gather your own dataset via the Twitter API or find datasets available on data sharing platforms like Kaggle. A commonly used dataset for sentiment analysis that includes tweets is the Sentiment140 dataset, which can be found on Kaggle:
     - [Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140)

Each source provides different ways to access and use the data, tailored to the nature of each project. If you need detailed instructions on how to use these APIs or libraries to download and prepare your data, feel free to ask!
